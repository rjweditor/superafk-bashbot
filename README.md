# Bash Mouse Movement Simulation Script

## Overview
This Bash script is designed to simulate mouse movements and interactions to prevent the computer from going into idle mode. It generates random mouse movements and occasional clicks to simulate human activity, preventing screensavers or sleep modes from activating.

## Prerequisites
- This script is designed for Unix-like operating systems that support the X Window System (X11).
- You need to have `xdotool` installed on your system. You can install it using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, or `brew`).

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

3. Make the script executable (if not already):
   ```bash
   chmod +x mouse_movement_simulation.sh

## Configuration

You can customize the behavior of the script by modifying the following variables at the beginning of the script:
screen_width and screen_height: Set the screen resolution to match your display's dimensions.
Adjust the thresholds and probabilities for mouse clicks, small mouse movements, and the time delays between actions as needed.

## Notes

This script is intended for educational and testing purposes. Use it responsibly and ensure that it complies with your organization's policies and guidelines.
